Hello!

# Fraud-Detection-System
This repository contains a simple End-to-end ML project with the aim to build up dashboard creation, coding, and model deployment skills.

The app address is "fraud-system.herokuapp.com"

The Technical Report directory contains a PDF explaining the design of the system and the thought process behind the design choices.

NOTE: The occurance of generated fraud has been increased to 1 in 5 transactions so that the dashboard can be demonstrated in a reasonable amount of time. 
Therefore, the static metrics will not match the dynamic metrics. The true occurance of fraud is set in the "lib\app_functions\new_transaction.py" file 
by changing the line "x=randint(0,4)" to "x=randint(0,587)"
